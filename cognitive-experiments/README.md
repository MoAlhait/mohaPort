# Cognitive Science Experiments

Interactive cognitive psychology experiments designed for college students (18-22). This web application implements three classic cognitive science experiments to help students understand fundamental concepts in cognitive psychology.

## Experiments Included

### 1. Stroop Effect Experiment
- **Purpose**: Demonstrates cognitive interference between automatic reading processes and color naming
- **Task**: Name the ink color of color words while ignoring what the word says
- **Measures**: Reaction time, accuracy, difference between congruent and incongruent trials

### 2. Memory Span Task
- **Purpose**: Tests working memory capacity and the limits of short-term memory
- **Task**: Memorize and recall sequences of numbers in order
- **Measures**: Memory span, accuracy by sequence length, response time

### 3. Visual Search Task
- **Purpose**: Examines visual attention and search mechanisms
- **Task**: Find target objects (red circles) among distractors
- **Measures**: Reaction time, accuracy, comparison between feature and conjunction search

## Features

- **Interactive Design**: Modern, responsive interface with smooth animations
- **Educational Content**: Detailed explanations of each experiment and what the results mean
- **Data Analysis**: Comprehensive results analysis with visual feedback
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Practice trials followed by test trials
- **Scientific Accuracy**: Based on established cognitive psychology research

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Technical Details

- Built with Next.js 14 and React 18
- Styled with Tailwind CSS
- Written in TypeScript for type safety
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

## Educational Value

These experiments help students understand:
- How automatic processes can interfere with controlled processes (Stroop Effect)
- The capacity limitations of working memory (Memory Span)
- The difference between parallel and serial visual search (Visual Search)

Perfect for cognitive psychology courses, research methods classes, or self-study in cognitive science.
