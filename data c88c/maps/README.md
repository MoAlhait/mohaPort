# Maps

Shared maps project. Add your map files here so you and your collaborator can work together via git.

## How we collaborate

- **Pull** before you start: `git pull origin main`
- **Commit** your changes: `git add .` then `git commit -m "your message"`
- **Push** when done: `git push origin main`

Your friend does the same on their side.
